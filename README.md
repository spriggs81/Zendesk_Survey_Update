# Zendesk_Survey_Update
This app was created to update a custom field in Users based on closed ticket by date range, and if that field already displays no.  In Zendesk the only way to complete this would be with an Automation, but this doesn't support searching closes tickets or completing an action on a closed ticket.  Needed to be done in the API.
